This assignment is designed to test your client-side coding skills and show us
what youâ€™re good at! You can add or modify any of the JavaScript, HTML and CSS
to complete the assignment. JQuery has been included for your convenience, but
is not required. Please do not use jQuery plugins. Also avoid frameworks like
Angular and Backbone. Please make sure the page works as a static page without
the need to run a web server or a build script.

First, prioritize the list of tasks below from high to low (1 -> top priority,
7-> lowest priority). Please explain why you choose to prioritize this way,
and what you considered when assigning high or low priority to each task.

Second, pick at least two tasks out of the list and implement them. You may choose
whatever tasks you prefer that you think will best reflect your coding skills.
Browser support should include IE8+, Chrome, Safari, FF.

Tasks
========================================

4 *  Imagine there is a JSON feed with hotels similar to the current one.
 	Design JSON format and use the feed to display similar hotels on the page.

2 *  Split the reviews into blocks of 5 and create pagination. Allow the user
	to sort the reviews by review score.

1 *  Improve the room table. Allow the user to sort the room table by occupancy
 	or price, display a total when the user selects a quantity, display
 	additional information about rooms. 

3 *  Create a photo carousel using the large photos linked from the thumbnails
	currently in the page. Include an automatic	slideshow mode, add prev/next
	buttons to manually controll the carousel, add a layer that shows the
	contents of the images alt text.

6 *  Improve the facilities block.

5 *  Add an interactive location block to the page. It should contain a map and
 	some nearby landmarks.

#Priorization Criteria & Reasoning 

I prioritized the tasks starting with the room table, because it was a feature that
was already in place, but it didn't provide a good user experience due to the lack
of feedback after changing any room quantities. Which made the feature feel "broken".

Then I considered splitting the reviews in pages as the second most important task
because the ease of navigability/usability of the page was severely hindered by the number of
reviews that the page has.

After that, the Photo Carousel would be the next task I consider as high priority,
because the current implementation has the photos visible, but a click on each one
navigates away from the page, breaking the navigation. It's also a good way to showcase
a series of images and the average user is already accustomed to the use of sliders/carousels.

I consider the next tasks as medium priority, as they provide an enhancement to the product
but they aren't critical tasks as they're not a half-baked or broken implementation.

Of those three tasks, I assigned the highest priority to creating a list of similar hotels from 
a JSON Feed. since the suggestion of another items, makes the user most likely to spend more time
browsing on the site and take further action (conversion).

Then, adding a location block on the page, with nearby places would also increase the conversion
rate because the service would give an added value on top of what's already offering, showing the
user additional motivation to take action.

Of all the tasks, I consider improving the facilities block of low importance, since the actual
implementation is easily consumable and it shows at a glance, which facilities are offered in a
specific hotel. However, this could easily be improved implementing more visual aid such as a 
representative icon for each type of facility. Which could in turn, give the possibility to include
such icons in lists (like the similar hotel list) when the users get accustomed to what each of them mean.
